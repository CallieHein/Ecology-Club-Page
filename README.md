# Ecology Club Page

A lightweight, responsive static site for a fictional Ecology Club. This repo is a project demo showcasing responsive CSS and a simple multimedia image grid.

Key points:
- Responsive layout using rem/em/% units
- Multimedia image grid in the About section (image placeholders only)
- Simple, accessible HTML and CSS; no JavaScript required

This README intentionally omits usage/setup instructions â€” the project is a static demo kept for reference.
